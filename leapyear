This Java program is designed to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not, based on the rules of the Gregorian calendar system.

A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. 
This logic is crucial in keeping our calendar in alignment with the Earth's revolutions around the Sun, adding an extra day to the month of February every four years.



import java.util.*;
public class Leapyear {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int year = sc.nextInt();
		if(year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0) {
			System.out.println("Leap year");
		}
		else {
			System.out.println("not leap year");
		}
 
	}
}



The program begins by importing the java.util.* package, which provides access to the Scanner class for user input.

It then prompts the user to input a year (as an integer).

The input is checked using conditional statements:

If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400, it is classified as a leap year.

Otherwise, it is considered not a leap year.

The result is printed to the console accordingly.
