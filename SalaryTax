This Java program demonstrates a simple income tax calculation based on a user's annual salary input. 
It uses conditional branching to determine the tax slab applicable to the salary amount and calculates the tax accordingly. 
This program is beginner-friendly and is helpful for understanding:

Basic Java syntax

User input handling using Scanner

Conditional statements (if, else if, else)

Arithmetic operations
import java.util.*;
public class Salary {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		long s = sc.nextLong();
		if(s<500000) {
			System.out.println("No tax");
		}
		else if(s>1000000) {
			System.out.println("Your tax is 20%");
			System.out.println("Your tax amount is "+ (s*20)/100);
		}
		else if(s>500000 || s<1000000){
			System.out.println("Tax is 10%");
			System.out.println("Your tax amount is "+ (s*10)/100);
		}

	}

}
